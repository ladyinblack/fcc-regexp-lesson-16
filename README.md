### [Match Beginning String Patterns](https://www.freecodecamp.org/learn/javascript-algorithms-and-data-structures/regular-expressions/match-beginning-string-patterns)

## PROBLEM EXPLANATION
Use the caret character in a regex to find `Cal` only in the beginning of the string `rickyAndCal`.

## HINTS
### Hint 1
Try surrounding your regexp in slashes
```js
let testExp = /^test/;
// returns true or false depending on whether test is found in the beginning of the string.
```
### Hint 2
Try using the `^` character caret outside of brackets as seen in the above example.
